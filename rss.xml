I’ve finally decided to end something I started &lt;strong&gt;3 years back&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;strong&gt;1097 days&lt;/strong&gt; of continuous learning, developing, collaborating and growing. Something I will remember for the rest of my life. I got to author some good personal projects and work with and contribute to organizations like &lt;a href=&quot;http://duckduckhack.com/u/manrajgrover/&quot;&gt;DuckDuckGo&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://mifos.org/&quot;&gt;OpenMF&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/&quot;&gt;Mozilla&lt;/a&gt;, and yes, &lt;a href=&quot;https://js.tensorflow.org&quot;&gt;TensorFlow&lt;/a&gt;. And it did take a good amount of dedication and sacrifices I can tell you. In this post, I’ll share the motivation behind this, challenges faced during this journey, the reason for ending it and everything in between. I’ll cover my learnings in a separate post which will also double up as my guide to open source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Wait, what? When did it even began?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was fall of 2015 and my final year of college had just begun. I already had an offer in a company (you know, one less thing to worry about) and had some time at my hand which I wanted to utilize well. I had few projects that I had started way back but never found time to complete and release them. Also, I was not happy with the quality of the code I used to write. I didn’t have anyone back then looking at my code and telling me how I can improve myself. Finally, I wanted to understand technologies in depth and build things using them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to complete what I had started and also learn something new every day. I needed some way to track progress and Github served to be the right platform. I started working on the projects, trying to make time for it every day but just as I thought, the initial spree didn’t last long and it broke in 2 weeks. I didn’t give up and planned to restart it. This time, with better management in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Initially, I worked on random projects that I had started for learning new things and soon moved towards building concrete things. Those were still the projects that no one would use but they did something and I learned things building them. These projects helped set up a good base for things I wanted to build in the future. I took those learnings and applied them while reviving the abandoned projects. I made them work using the best practices I knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Soon, I stopped keeping track of it. It became a habit to think about what I would do today and the resources I would need to refer. I would plan my day well in advance and prioritize things accordingly. I learned the skill of time hacking and I still reap the benefits of it.
I never publicized or told anyone about what I was doing and why for a couple of reasons. I didn’t want any publicity with this regard. And secondly, it was a personal experiment which may or may not help anyone. And I still didn’t have enough positive results to recommend someone something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did, however, have some people laugh and mock me who saw my Github profile. But I didn’t care much. For what I knew, I had nothing to lose and everything to gain. The only investment was time which I didn’t want to spend watching a famous series. I like how &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler&quot;&gt;Ken Wheeler&lt;/a&gt; puts it and I &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/codezillas/a-bitter-guide-to-open-source-a8e3b6a3c1c4&quot;&gt;quote&lt;/a&gt; him:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fuck those people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized putting a constraint is a powerful concept when I decided to code a project exploring what one can do with a single &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element. Through this, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manrajgrover/SingleDivProject&quot;&gt;SingleDivProject&lt;/a&gt; was born. Having a constraint enabled me to learn CSS properties I didn’t know existed just to achieve a design I wanted. It was well received and motivated me to code more of successful projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started contributing to projects and organizations like DuckDuckGo with great maintainers just to get feedback on my code quality. Do you see how advantageous this is for everyone? I add a feature to their codebase reducing maintainer’s overhead. My code gets reviewed and I get to improve my coding skills. The pull request gets merged and the project users are happy with the new feature. Win-win?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Weeks turned into months. Months turned into years. I grew as a developer and so did my ambitions. I started writing packages and command-line tools. I would make sure I do something I haven’t done before. If I learned something new, I would code and incorporate them into my projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I aligned my new-found interests with Open Source projects and started contributing to deeplearn.js, which later became &lt;a href=&quot;https://js.tensorflow.org&quot;&gt;TensorFlow.js&lt;/a&gt;. I learned a lot about inner workings of a machine learning library, various algorithms and how they can be implemented efficiently. I’ll surely have a separate post where I’ll share my experience contributing to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why I’m ending it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, why should I end it if everything is going so well? There are a couple of reasons for it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Learnings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve really learned a lot of things in the past 3 years, from both technical and non-technical perspective. I’m now confident enough to manage my time, pick up new technologies, best practices, work on large codebases, deploy things and a whole lot more. But now, I wish to learn things that can only be achieved if I move away from this constraint of contributing every day. Things that will take more than a day before they can be committed and months to complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Changing goals&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve achieved the goals I had set for myself with regard to the contribution spree. I’ve checked every single box of the list of goals I had and it’s time to focus on other goals. My interests are inclining more towards research, specifically machine learning and would like to focus on and give full attention to it. Who knows I might start an open source machine learning project? Who knows I might do something like this on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kaggle.com/manrajsingh&quot;&gt;Kaggle&lt;/a&gt;? 😉&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So, yeah!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m ending my contribution spree today i.e. October 12, 2018. It has been an unforgettable experience and I don’t think I will be able to replicate it again. I will still keep contributing to Open Source, keep working on my projects, keep contributing to various organizations, just without worrying about this constraint. I hope it works out well. I love how &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@jedwatson&quot;&gt;Jed Watson&lt;/a&gt; puts &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.freecodecamp.org/github-broke-my-1-000-day-streak-6ec0c4c3a7d9&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s been a personal journey played out in a public space, and so this seems like a fitting way to wrap it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, would I now recommend someone to follow in my footsteps? No, definitely not. However, I would recommend smaller sprints of a couple of weeks and a break after that. Put a time frame on something you wish to achieve and have a strict deadline. And don’t forget to reward yourself with your favorite dessert after every achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And like always, I encourage more people to contribute to Open Source. Believe me, you will definitely learn a lot! I recommend reading &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/ken_wheeler&quot;&gt;Ken&lt;/a&gt;’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/codezillas/a-bitter-guide-to-open-source-a8e3b6a3c1c4&quot;&gt;guide&lt;/a&gt; to Open Source. I can relate to a lot of things shared in the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me know if I can be of any help. I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/manrajsgrover&quot;&gt;@manrajsgrover&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/manrajgrover&quot;&gt;@manrajgrover&lt;/a&gt; on Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Till next time. ✌️&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Contributing and bringing machine learning to JavaScript ecosystem with TensorFlow.js]]></title><description><![CDATA[It has been great 4 years contributing to open source.

One of my main motive behind contributing to a project is &lt;a href=&quot;https://manrajsingh.in/blog/why-im-ending-commit-a-day/&quot;&gt;learning&lt;/a&gt;. So a year back, when I was exploring the field of Machine Learning, I stumbled upon a project called &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/08/harness-power-of-machine-learning-in.html&quot;&gt;deeplearn.js&lt;/a&gt;. It was recently open sourced by &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.google/research/teams/brain/pair&quot;&gt;Google + PAIR Code initiative&lt;/a&gt; and focused on bringing machine learning to the web. I decided to get involved in the project for multiple reasons:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning on the client side is great for privacy and would enable real-time experiences and visualizations. Also, +1 for &lt;a href=&quot;https://ai.googleblog.com/2017/04/federated-learning-collaborative.html&quot;&gt;federated learning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It was fairly new and didn’t have many operations and algorithms implemented. This would give me the opportunity to implement them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It made use of technologies I didn’t have experience with and wanted to learn them at some point in time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working on a new code base is always overwhelming at first. I started by reading the documentation and trying to understand how individual methods work and how they exploit WebGL for fast computations. While doing this, I found a few bugs on the website and thought of fixing them. The contribution process was just like any other open source project:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open an issue elaborating on the bug you found and how you think it can be fixed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prepare a well-written, well-tested and well-documented pull request explaining what the fix does exactly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The community was very welcoming. I had my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core/pull/214&quot;&gt;first pull request&lt;/a&gt; merged in no time. This motivated me to fix more and more bugs. When I was comfortable with the codebase, I started implementing methods that were missing from the API including mathematical, logical and control flow operations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;deeplearn.js provided a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graphs&quot;&gt;graph-based&lt;/a&gt; API (similar to TensorFlow) which was replaced by the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager&quot;&gt;eager mode&lt;/a&gt; during the migration to TensorFlow.js. I worked on implementing gradients for various operations and optimizers enabling them to be invoked eagerly. A good part of my contributions went into fixing documentation and development aspects of the project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tensorflow.org/dev-summit/&quot;&gt;TensorFlow Dev Summit 2018&lt;/a&gt;, the announcement regarding deeplearn.js becoming part of the TensorFlow organization as TensorFlow.js was made. This opened up the project to a wider community and enabling new tools to be built around it. deeplearn.js became &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-core&quot;&gt;TensorFlow.js Core API&lt;/a&gt; which mimics TensorFlow Python API. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-layers&quot;&gt;Layers API&lt;/a&gt; was introduced which acts as an abstraction over Core API for easy development of ML models (like &lt;a href=&quot;https://keras.io/&quot;&gt;Keras&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-converter&quot;&gt;TensorFlow.js Converter&lt;/a&gt; allowed developers to use already trained TensorFlow models to be executed in the browser. Finally, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-node&quot;&gt;TensorFlow.js Node API&lt;/a&gt; binds TensorFlow C API to Node.js allowing developers to use JavaScript on servers for training and inference purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With more people getting involved and building projects over TensorFlow.js,  the project became more developer focused. This also required building &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-examples&quot;&gt;examples&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models&quot;&gt;models&lt;/a&gt; that would showcase the capabilities of the project. I shifted my focus to developing them for the project website. The team shared a well-curated list of examples with me. While building these examples, I found some loss and reduction operations to be missing and implemented those.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a great journey contributing to TensorFlow.js and I’ve really learned a lot during the process. Shout out to the whole team, especially &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/nsthorat&quot;&gt;Nikhil Thorat&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/dsmilkov&quot;&gt;Daniel Smilkov&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/sqcai&quot;&gt;Shanqing Cai&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/xtan&quot;&gt;Stanley Bileschi&lt;/a&gt; for building such a wonderful project and guiding me throughout my contributions. You all are awesome! I’m really excited to see new contributors getting involved in the project and other projects being built over TensorFlow.js. The future of machine learning on the web is bright and I’m happy to be a small part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, thanks to the Google Open Source team for recognizing my efforts, honoring me with the Google Open Source Peer Bonus award and giving me the opportunity to share my experience with everyone through this post.&lt;/p&gt;
